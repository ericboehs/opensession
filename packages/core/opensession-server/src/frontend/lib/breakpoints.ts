 * The app's one breakpoint, in the one place both halves of the app read it.

 * The query is authored twice by necessity: `styles/tailwind.css` declares it
 * as the `phone:` / `desktop:` variants for markup, and TypeScript needs it as
 * a string for `matchMedia`. What is not necessary is authoring it twice on the
 * TypeScript side, which is what `useIsPhone` and `useBackSwipe` each did.
 * Moving the boundary in one of them would have left the other answering for
 * the old one, and the failure is quiet: the layout flips at the new width
 * while the behaviour that layout assumes flips at the old one.
 *
 * `breakpoints.test.ts` pins this constant to the stylesheet, so moving the
 * boundary stays one edit plus a failing test that names every other place.
