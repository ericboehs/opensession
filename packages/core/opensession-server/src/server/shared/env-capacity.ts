/**
 * Bounded integer capacity overrides from the environment.
 *
 * Capacity knobs are read once at module load: they size long-lived pools and
 * gates, so a live process never resizes them mid-flight. An invalid value
 * keeps the built-in default instead of throwing — a typo in a drop-in must
 * not prevent boot.
 *
 * Mind which process reads a knob: the gateway loads ~/.opensession.env, but
 * the session-kernel and executor services deliberately do not. Their knobs
 * only take effect through a dedicated systemd drop-in (`Environment=`) on
 * that service, never through the application environment file.
