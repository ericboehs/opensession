/**
 * The live bubble's text, and the bookkeeping that keeps one block of a reply
 * from showing twice.
 *
 * A turn's assistant text reaches a viewer along two routes: as stream frames
 * while the model writes it, and as a durable transcript entry once the block
 * finishes. Whichever arrives second has to cancel the first, or the same
 * paragraph renders twice — once above the tool steps as a landed entry, once
 * at the bottom in the still-live bubble. Every surface that shows a running
 * turn owns that problem (the server's reconnect feed, the web viewer, the
 * native app), so the rule lives here once instead of being re-derived per
 * client.
 *
 * Blocks carry the engine's own id when it names them (`blockId` on
 * stream_text; the durable entry for that block uses the SAME id). That makes
 * cancelling exact — no amount of normalizing, clamping or half-delivering
 * the text can turn a match into a miss. Engines that name nothing fall back
 * to string subtraction, which is what shipped before ids existed: take the
 * landed block out of the buffer, or — when only its head has streamed —
 * clear the buffer and swallow the remainder as it arrives.
 *
 * The fallback is why `land` is not simply "drop by id": a block can reach a
 * viewer with no id at all (a feed snapshot replays the whole active bubble
 * as one anonymous run of text), and that copy still has to be cancellable.
