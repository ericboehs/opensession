/// the viewer can never drive it. The image has to zoom where it already is.

/// Two UIKit facts shape the rest. The recognizer cannot live on this
/// overlay: the overlay hit-tests through (otherwise it would eat the tap and
/// the scroll), and UIKit only feeds a touch to recognizers on the hit-tested
/// view and its ancestors — which this view isn't, since SwiftUI draws the
/// whole transcript into one hosting view. So the recognizer goes on the
/// enclosing `UIScrollView`, which sees every touch anyway, and a bounds gate
/// decides whether a given pinch belongs to THIS image. And a scroll view's
/// pan takes any number of fingers, so two fingers scroll the transcript
/// unless scrolling is switched off for the duration.
