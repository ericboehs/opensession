/// property read there re-evaluates the whole bar, and this one changes
/// mid-utterance. The `Dictation` object is OWNED by the bar and passed in —
/// held as `@State` here it would be destroyed the moment a long dictation
/// wrapped the composer to two rows and swapped which layout branch renders
/// the button.
