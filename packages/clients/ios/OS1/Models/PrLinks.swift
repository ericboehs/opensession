/// A turn that opens a PR says so — "opened opensession#128", or pastes the
/// GitHub URL — and on the web that sentence carries a chip tinted by the PR's
/// live state, which opens the review in place. Natively the URL was an
/// external link that threw you into Safari, and `owner/repo#123` was plain
/// text. Both become one thing here: a markdown link on a private scheme,
/// intercepted through `openURL` like every other transcript chip.
///
/// The rules are the web's (src/frontend/lib/markdown.ts), because a reference
/// must mean the same thing in both clients:
///
/// - A mention only links when its repo is one this instance actually serves.
///   `vercel/next.js#1234` stays text rather than pointing a third party's
///   number at one of our repos.
/// - A QUALIFIED mention (`opensession#128`) always links. A BARE `#123` does
///   not, unless its number is long enough to be a PR rather than prose (short
///   `#numbers` are usually a step, a hex colour or a ranking) or the sessions
///   list already knows a PR by that number in the repo being read.
/// - The word `PR` in front of a short number is the other cue that says PR,
///   which is what lets `PR #92` link in a repo numbered under a thousand.
///
/// Conservative in the same way as the other rewrites: code — fenced,
/// indented, or a span — is left alone, and a URL already inside a link keeps
/// its own destination unless that destination is itself a PR we can open.
